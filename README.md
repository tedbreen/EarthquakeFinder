## Bluewolf coding challenge #2

1. Create a web page that takes as input A city/location name.
2. This page should call the GeoNames Recent Earthquake WebService (http://www.geonames.org/export/JSON-webservices.html#earthquakesJSON), with a bounding box dictated by the city entered.
3. Plot the results on a Google Map (https://developers.google.com/maps/). Each marker on this map should display details of the earthquake plotted.

### Bonus:

4. Create a list of the top 10 largest earthquakes in the world for the last 12 months.  This should be displayed somewhere on the page.
